# Brain Tumor Analysis

## Objectives
- Analyze patterns of brain tumor occurrences based on patient demographics and medical history.
- Identify common tumor types and their distribution across different age groups.
- Examine the impact of early detection on treatment outcomes.
- Evaluate the effectiveness of different diagnostic techniques (MRI, CT scans, biopsy).
- Provide an interactive dashboard summarizing key medical insights.

## Dataset Used
- **Source**: Dataset containing patient records, tumor types, diagnostic results, and treatment responses.

## Functional Requirements
### Dashboard Elements
#### Tumor Overview
- Total number of recorded brain tumor cases.
- Common tumor types and their frequency.
- Age and gender distribution of patients.

#### Diagnosis & Severity Trends
- Tumor classifications (Benign, Malignant).
- Distribution of diagnostic techniques (MRI, CT, Biopsy).
- Correlation between early diagnosis and survival rates.

#### Treatment & Recovery Analysis
- Treatment effectiveness across tumor types.
- Patient recovery rates based on treatment methods.
- Impact of tumor size and location on treatment success.

### Visual Components
- **Bar Charts**: Tumor distribution across age groups and gender.
- **Pie Charts**: Common diagnostic methods used.
- **Heatmaps**: Severity trends and affected brain regions.
- **Line Graphs**: Survival rates over time based on treatment types.
